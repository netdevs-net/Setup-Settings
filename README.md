# DevOps: Terminal & Visual Studio Code settings
This is a place to save my settings to save time when moving from machine to machine.

## CMD 
These are the command line prompts.

### Powershell
![Make a Rainbow prompt for VS Code](Settings-vscode.jpg?raw=true "Rainbow Prompt on VS Code")
Download and install Starship.rs, and then configure for the GruvBox Rainbow theme.
Use these settings to get this Starship.rs working in Powershell. 

The extra space in the command line was a trick to overcome. Turns out the character mapping in /starship.toml needs a different set of icon characters to remove the space. PowerShell > .config > <a href="/Powershell/.config/starship.toml" target="_blank">starship.toml</a>. 

This is the correct file for VSCode Terminal Starship GruvBox Rainbow remove extra space in prompt.  

### Visual Studio Code
VSCode has user-specific application settings. Remember to configure these within the local machine > Settings interface.
